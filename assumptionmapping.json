  "description": "A structured technique to identify, visualize, and prioritize the assumptions behind a product idea\'97especially those that are risky and uncertain. Assumptions are plotted on a 2x2 matrix of Risk (impact if wrong) and Uncertainty (how confident we are it's true). This helps teams focus validation efforts on the riskiest and least known aspects of their idea.",\
  "purpose": "To avoid building products based on untested or invalid assumptions by proactively identifying and prioritizing what needs to be validated.",\
