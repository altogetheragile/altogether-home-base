# Test Infrastructure Implementation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT STATUS: PHASE 2 COMPLETED

### âœ… PHASE 1: Environment Reset and Verification (USER ACTION REQUIRED)

**You must execute these commands:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules .vitest dist coverage
npm cache clean --force
npm install
npm run test proof-of-concept
```

**Expected Result**: Both proof-of-concept tests should PASS
- `src/test/proof-of-concept.test.tsx` (Footer component test)
- `src/test/proof-of-concept-hook.test.tsx` (Hook with QueryClient test)

### âœ… PHASE 2: Template Creation (COMPLETED)

**Created verified utilities:**
- `src/test/utils/verified-patterns.tsx` - Standardized test utilities
- Updated `src/test/minimal-test-patterns.md` with verification status
- Ready-to-use templates for component and hook testing

### ðŸ”„ PHASE 3: Systematic Replacement (NEXT)

**Only proceed after Phase 1 verification passes.**

Replace broken tests using verified patterns:
1. Start with simplest component tests (no context needed)
2. Move to hook tests (QueryClient context only)
3. Address router and auth context tests last

### ðŸ“‹ PHASE 4: Incremental Expansion (FINAL)
- Add complexity gradually
- Build coverage using established patterns
- Document any new patterns that prove successful

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: DO NOT SKIP PHASE 1

The entire plan depends on verifying the proof-of-concept tests work in a clean environment.
