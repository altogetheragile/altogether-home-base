    "description": "A structured technique to identify, visualize, and prioritize the assumptions behind a product idea\u2014especially those that are risky and uncertain. Assumptions are plotted on a 2x2 matrix of Risk (impact if wrong) and Uncertainty (how confident we are it\u2019s true). This helps teams focus validation efforts on the riskiest and least known aspects of their idea.",
